Also remember that seminars, lecture slides, [Google](http://google.com) and [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) are your close friends during this course (and, probably, whole life?).\n",

        "* Your **SOLUTION** notebook **MUST BE REPRODUCIBLE**, i.e., if the reviewer decides to restart the notebook and run all cells, after all the computation he will obtain exactly the same solution (with all the corresponding plots) as in your uploaded notebook. For this purpose, we suggest fixing random `seed` or (better) define `random_state=` inside every algorithm that uses some pseudorandomness.\n",

        "Stacking is an ensembling approach, which combines several algorithms (base models) to get better results. This is achieved by **a)** training the base models (any ML models) on the initial train data (or parts of the train data, see the paragraph below), **b)** training the meta-model (also an ML model) on the predictions of those base models.\n",
        "\n",
        "One of the main problems of stacking is overfitting. To avoid it, when evaluating the performance of the meta-model on the train set, the training data is divided into $ n $ folds, $ (n-1) $ of which are used for training the base models. The $ n $ -th fold is used for the overall prediction (calculating the meta-factor) in the following manner: the predictions on the $ n $ -th fold are made by the base models (already trained on the rest of the dataset), then these predictions on the $ n $ -th fold are fed as inputs to the meta-model.\n",
        "\n",
        "When evaluating the performance of the meta-model on the test set, there can be used various approaches$.^{[1]}$ For example, in order, to obtain meta-factors for the test data, the base classifiers can be retrained on the entire training set, since the problem of overfitting does not arise here. In other words, if we want to calculate the factors for the test set, we can safely use the training set to train the base classifiers (once again, as it is said in the paragraph above, if we want to calculate factors for the training set, then it is necessary to ensure that the classifier does not predict for those objects on which it has been trained).  \n",
        "\n",
        "You can read more details about stacking [blockpost](https://blog.statsbot.co/ensemble-learning-d1dcd548e936), [kaggle ensemble guide](https://mlwave.com/kaggle-ensembling-guide/).\n",
        "\n",
        "P.S. Stacking and Blending are two similar approaches to combining classifiers (ensembling). The difference is that Stacking uses out-of-fold predictions for the train set, and Blending uses a validation set to train the next layer ([source](quora.com/What-are-examples-of-blending-and-stacking-in-Machine-Learning)). Because they are so similar you can use any of them. \n",
